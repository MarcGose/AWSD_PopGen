# AWSD_PopGen
This repository contains all scripts for the processing of raw DArTseq reads of Atlantic white-sided dolphins and all downstream population genetics analyses. Files were aligned with BWA and genotype likelihoods calculated in ANGSD. Analysis include estimation of population structure using PCAngsd, DAPC, KLFDAPC and NGSadmix, estimation of IBD and individual pairwise relatedness using PLINK and NGSrelate and estimation of inbreeding and genetic diversity (sMLH) in PLINK and InbreedR.

Manuscript "Stranding collections uncover connectivity and cryptic relatedness in a pelagic marine predator, the Atlantic whiteâ€‘sided dolphin (Lagenorhynchus acutus)" currently under revision.
